> **Note:**
> Some of the unavailable features mentioned above already work to some degree. 
> 
> For instance, it is possible to use the AirPlay button from the Bitmovin Player UI to play back content on an AirPlay 
> receiver. However, AirPlay related player events, API calls and configuration options are not yet fully exposed to the 
> Dart side. 
> 
> The same holds for subtitles and captions. They are available to be selected from the UI and they are also rendered, 
> however, the full API surface related to subtitles is not yet available from Dart code.

# Get Started
If you want to play around with the code, implement a new feature or just run the example apps, follow along with this section. If you just want to use the player in your own flutter app, you can skip this and follow the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section.

- [Install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) `flutter` on your machine
- Install `Node.js` and `npm` on your machine
- Run `npm ci` in the root of the cloned repository
  - This will setup [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) powered pre-commit git hooks

## For iOS Development
- Install `Mint` on your machine (e.g. `brew install mint`)
- Run `mint bootstrap` in the root of the cloned repository to install packages from `Mintfile`

To build the example project with your own developer account, create the config file 
`example/iOS/Flutter/Developer.xcconfig`. In this file, add your development team like this:

```yml
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = YOUR_TEAM_ID
```

## For Android Development
- Install `ktlint` (e.g. `brew install ktlint`)

## Example App
To be able to use the example app, follow these steps:
1. Create a file named `.env` in the project root
1. Put your private bitmovin player license key inside the newly created `.env` file as `BITMOVIN_PLAYER_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY`, replacing `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` with your license key which can be obtained from [Bitmovin's Dashboard](https://bitmovin.com/dashboard)
1. In the [Dashboard](https://bitmovin.com/dashboard), add `com.bitmovin.player.flutter.example` as an allowed package name
1. Run `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` in the project root which should generate the missing `example/lib/env/env.g.dart` file
1. Start the example app by running the command `flutter run` inside the `example/` directory

# Installation
The `bitmovin_player` package is still under development and not yet published to [pub.dev](https://pub.dev). 
However, it can be used as a local dependency in any Flutter app. To do so, add the `bitmovin_player` dependency with the
correct relative path to your app's `pubspec.yaml` as show exemplary below:

```yml
dependencies:
  bitmovin_player:
    path: ./../bitmovin-player-flutter
```

## Android Specific Steps
Add Bitmovin's maven repo to `android/build.gradle`:
```gradle
maven {
    url 'https://artifacts.bitmovin.com/artifactory/public-releases'
}
```

## iOS Specific Steps
Add Bitmovin's Cocoapod repo as a source on top of `ios/Podfile`:
```ruby
source 'https://github.com/bitmovin/cocoapod-specs.git'
```

If you see any errors during `pod install` after adding the source from above, try deleting `Podfile.lock` and do a 
fresh `pod install`. At this point, `pod install` might fail due to the incorrect minimum deployment target being set 
for the `Runner` project. Set the deployment target and minimum deployment version to at least iOS 14 in `Runner` 
project to fix this.

```ruby
platform :ios, '14.0'
source 'https://github.com/bitmovin/cocoapod-specs.git'

## The rest of your Podfile ##
```

## Providing a Bitmovin Player License Key
When a `Player` instance is created, it will need a Bitmovin Player license key which has to be set in the `PlayerConfig` that is used to create the `Player`. 

To obtain a Bitmovin Player license key, please visit [Bitmovin's Dashboard](https://bitmovin.com/dashboard). Furthermore, make sure to associate your iOS and Android app bundle identifiers with your license key. More information on that can be found [here](https://bitmovin.com/docs/player/getting-started/ios#step-3-configure-your-player-license).

Now, you can provide your license key via the `PlayerConfig`:
```dart
final player = Player(
  config: const PlayerConfig(
    key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY',
  ),
);
```

# Example code
The example app demonstrates some of the most basic but also more advanced use cases how the Bitmovin Player can be used and integrated. Please refer to the [Example App](#example-app) section to learn how to run it.

The code for the different examples is located under [example/lib/pages](example/lib/pages). This is a good place to start learning about how to use the player.

# Documentation
To generate code documentation files, run `dart doc .` in the root folder of the repository.
