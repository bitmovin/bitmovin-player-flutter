# Get Started
- Install `flutter` on your machine if you haven't already
- Install `Node.js` and `npm` on your machine if you haven't already
- Enter the repo and run `npm ci`

## For iOS development
- Install `Mint` on your machine if you haven't already (`brew install mint`)

## For Android development
- Install `ktlint` (`brew install ktlint`)

## Example App
To be able to use the example app, follow these steps:
1. Create a file named `.env` in the project root
1. Put your private bitmovin player license key inside the newly created `.env` file as `BITMOVIN_PLAYER_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY`, replacing `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` with your license key which can be obtained from [Bitmovin's Dashboard](bitmovin.com/dashboard)
1. In the [Dashboard](bitmovin.com/dashboard), add `com.bitmovin.player.flutter.example` as an allowed package name
1. Run `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` in the project root which should generate the missing `example/lib/env/env.g.dart` file
1. Start the example app by running the command `flutter run` inside the `example/` directory


# Installation

Run the following command to install **bitmovin_player**

`flutter pub add bitmovin_player`

</br>

## Android
No extra steps needed.

</br>

## iOS
Add this source on top of your `Podfile`
```terminal
source https://github.com/bitmovin/cocoapod-specs.git
```

</br>

eg:
```script

# Uncomment this line to define a global platform for your project
platform :ios, '14.0'
source 'https://github.com/bitmovin/cocoapod-specs.git'

... The rest of your PodFile ...

target 'Runner' do
  # use_frameworks!
  use_modular_headers!

  pod 'BitmovinPlayer', '3.37.1'
  
  flutter_install_all_ios_pods File.dirname(File.realpath(__FILE__))
end
```

</br>

# Setting up the Player License Key

There are two ways to add your **License Key**

first will be via your **Platform Manifest** file `info.plist` for **iOS** and `AndroidManifet.xml` for **Android**.

second is programmatically.

## Android

Open `/android/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and add the following code.

```xml
<application>
  <meta-data android:name="BITMOVIN_PLAYER_LICENSE_KEY" android:value="YOUR_LICENSE_KEY" />
</application>
```

</br>

## iOS

Open `/ios/Runner/info.plist` and add the following code.

```xml
<dict>
  <key>BitmovinPlayerLicenseKey</key>
  <string>YOUR_LICENSE_KEY</string>
</dict>
```

</br>

## Via code

You can add your license key via the `PlayerConfig` object

example
```dart
final player = Player(PlayerConfig(licenseKey: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY'))
```

</br>

# Setting up the playback configuration

If needed, the default player behavior can be configured through the `PlayerConfig`.

```dart
class PlayerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final _player = Player(
    const PlayerConfig(
      playbackConfig: PlaybackConfig(
        isAutoplayEnabled: true,
        isMuted: true,
      ),
    ),
  );

  @override
  void build(BuildContent context) {
    return SizeBox.from(
      size: Size.fromHeight(230),
      child: PlayerView(
        player: _player,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

</br>

# Basic Playback

Bare minimum code needed to start using `Player` with `PlayerView`.

```dart
class PlayerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  Player _player = Player();

  SourceConfig _sourceConfig = SourceConfig(
    url: Platform.isAndroid ? "https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/MI201109210084_1/mpds/f08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.mpd" : 'https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/MI201109210084_1/m3u8s/f08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.m3u8',
    type: Platform.isAndroid ? SourceType.dash : SourceType.hls,
  ),

  void _onViewCreated(Player player) {
    _player.loadWithSourceConfig(_sourceConfig);
  }

  @override
  void build(BuildContent context) {
    return SizeBox.from(
      size: Size.fromHeight(230),
      child: PlayerView(
        player: _player,
        onViewCreated: _onViewCreated,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

</br>

# Basic playback (Audio Only)

Bare minimum code needed to start using `Player` without the `PlayerView`

`control.dart`
```dart
typedef ControlAction = void Function()?;

class Controls extends StatelessWidget {
  const Controls({
    super.key,
    required this.onPlayPressed,
    required this.onPausePressed,
    required this.onLoadPressed,
    required this.onMutePressed,
    required this.onUnmutePressed,
  });

  final ControlAction onPlayPressed;
  final ControlAction onPausePressed;
  final ControlAction onLoadPressed;
  final ControlAction onMutePressed;
  final ControlAction onUnmutePressed;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Row(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
          children: [
            OutlinedButton(
              onPressed: onPlayPressed,
              child: const Text('PLAY'),
            ),
            OutlinedButton(
              onPressed: onPausePressed,
              child: const Text('PAUSE'),
            ),
            OutlinedButton(
              onPressed: onLoadPressed,
              child: const Text('LOAD'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
        Row(
          mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
          children: [
            OutlinedButton(
              onPressed: onMutePressed,
              child: const Text('Mute'),
            ),
            OutlinedButton(
              onPressed: onUnmutePressed,
              child: const Text('Unmute'),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

`playerscreen.dart`
```dart
class PlayerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  build(BuildContent context) {
    
    Player _player = Player();
    SourceConfig _sourceConfig = SourceConfig(
      url: Platform.isAndroid ? "https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/MI201109210084_1/mpds/f08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.mpd" : 'https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/MI201109210084_1/m3u8s/f08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.m3u8',
      type: Platform.isAndroid ? SourceType.dash : SourceType.hls,
    );

    void _onViewCreated(Player player) {
      player.loadWithSourceConfig(_sourceConfig);
    }

    return Column(
      children: [
        Controls(
          onPlayPressed: () => _player.play(),
          onPausePressed: () => _player.pause(),
          onLoadPressed: () => _player.loadWithSourceConfig(_sourceConfig),
          onMutePressed: () => _player.mute(),
          onUnmutePressed: () => _player.unmute(),
        ),
        PlayerView(
          player: _player,
        ),
      ]
    )
  }
}
```

# Subscribing to Events

The following example demonstrates how to subscribe to an `Event` of the `Player` and `Source`

```dart
class PlayerScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  Player _player = Player();

  SourceConfig _sourceConfig = SourceConfig(
    url: Platform.isAndroid ? "https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/MI201109210084_1/mpds/f08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.mpd" : 'https://bitmovin-a.akamaihd.net/content/MI201109210084_1/m3u8s/f08e80da-bf1d-4e3d-8899-f0f6155f6efa.m3u8',
    type: Platform.isAndroid ? SourceType.dash : SourceType.hls,
  ),

  void listToEvent() {
    _player.onReady = (ReadyEvent data) {
      print('Got on ready event');
    }
    _player.onTimeChanged = (TimeChangedEvent data) {
      print('Got on time changed event');
    }
    _player.onPause = (PausedEventdata) {
      print('Got on pause event');
    }
    _player.onMute = (MutedEvent data) {
      print('Got on mute event');
    }
    _player.onUnmute = (UnmutedEvent data) {
      print('Got on unmute event');
    }
  }

  @override
  void initState() {
    listenToEvent();
    super.initState();
  }

  @override
  void build(BuildContent context) {
    return SizeBox.from(
      size: Size.fromHeight(230),
      child: PlayerView(
        player: _player,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

# Publishing package to **pub.dev**

First, sign in to pub.dev with your Google Account.

Before publishing, make sure to review the `pubspec.yaml`, `README.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` files.

Update the `version` property on the `pubspec.yaml` if needed.

Next, run the publish command in **dry-run** mode to see if everything passes analysis:

```terminal
flutter pub publish --dry-run
```

If there is any error solve it else we can publish it to pub.dev.
But be sure that you are ready because publishing is forever.
we canâ€™t remove the package from there. So if you are ready, run following command:

```terminal
flutter pub publish
```

For authentication, one link will be provided, just open in browser and select your google account.
Wait for uploading.
And itâ€™s Done, Hurrah! You have created your own Futter Package.

You can search for your package on the ***https://pub.dev*** site after some time, It will take a few minutes.
